# Sulaiman Alam — Personal Portfolio

This repository contains a clean, dark, masculine-styled static portfolio site (HTML/CSS/JS).

## Files

- `index.html` — Main page (hero, about, skills, experience, education, projects, footer)
- `styles.css` — Styling with dark theme, card layout and simple animations
- `main.js` — Interactivity: toggles, fade-in on scroll, scroll-to-top, mobile-friendly behavior
- `README.md` — This file

## Notable Features

- **Masculine dark aesthetic**: strong contrast, cool accent color, clean typography.
- **Updated Education**: Cornell Tech M.Eng. (May 2026) and CUNY Queens College B.A. details with honors, coursework and GPA.
- **Experience & Education toggles**: View/hide detail lists for neat presentation.
- **Fade-in on scroll**: Sections animate into view for a modern feel.
- **Smooth scroll**: Clicking nav links scrolls smoothly to sections.
- **Scroll-to-top** button for convenience.
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout and accessible toggles (aria-expanded).

## How to use

1. Place the files in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required).
3. Optional: host on GitHub Pages or Netlify for a live site.

## Future ideas

- Add downloadable resume (PDF).
- Replace stock hero image with a professional portrait.
- Add project detail modals or case study pages.
- Add analytics and email capture.
- Convert to React + Tailwind or Next.js for dynamic content and deployment.
